# Guessing-Game-on-Steroids
In this java program, it functions as a Guessing Game. However, the challenge is that the words chosen for the user to guess is found in a text file! For the people that want to try this, just replace the filepath to the path of your choosing where you can locate the text file. For this particular program, I used Genshin Impact characters as the theme of what I want the user to guess!

Note: If you want to edit the words.txt file, make sure that the word you want the user to guess is separated line by line.
